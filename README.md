Named Entity Recognition (NER) Using Hugging Face Transformers

# Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a transformer-based model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the Hugging Face transformers library. The implementation is based on the Jupyter Notebook Build_a_Powerful_NER_Model_with_Hugging_Face_Transformers.

# Dataset

The notebook utilizes a structured NER dataset in CSV format.

The dataset contains text along with entity annotations.

The Entities column is pre-labeled with entity tags.
